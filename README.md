<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this assignment, you will write a very simple ray tracer. The core requirement is to trace a sphere and a cube with C# code and Unity. This introductory assignment aims at getting you familiar with the Unity game framework as well as C# programming, and practise basic operations with ray, geometry and shading/texturing.




<ul>

 <li>The deadline is firm as the first assignment is designed with low difficulty and no “advanced requirements”.</li>

 <li>You’re free to use any technology you like to program assignments, but Unity is recommended for beginners. If you use anything other than Unity, make sure you talk to your TA/instructor before you submit. You’re responsible to implement all functionality by yourself, including those code samples given in the lab session, and the assignment requirements, with own preferred technology.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

Generate the following renderings, with the given ray-tracing code framework in Unity or your preferred graphical programming technology.

In this assignment, <u>​<strong>the only graphics API allowed is</strong></u><strong> <u>Unity’s Texture2D.SetPixel(x, y, color)</u></strong><u>​</u>, or similar functionalities in other frameworks.  ​<strong><u>All calculations of ray</u> <u>geometry, intersection, shading and UV mapping need to</u> <u>be demonstrated in your own (CPU-side) code.</u> </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Implement ray-sphere intersection and render a sphere with ambient, diffuse and specular lighting (40%).</li>

</ol>




<ol start="2">

 <li>Implement ray-triangle intersection and visualize the barycentric coordinate on each of the triangles of a</li>

</ol>

cube, with Red, Green and Blue for each coordinate.

(30%)







<ol start="3">

 <li>Implement UV mapping with the calculated barycentric coordinate in the previous step, and visualize a texture image on each face of the cube. (choose any texture you like)</li>

</ol>
